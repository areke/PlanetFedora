While these blog posts don't necessarily reflect the opinions of the [Fedora Project](http://fedoraproject.org), they do express the viewpoints of the individuals contributing to Fedora Planet. This application for Android devices was written to make it faster and easier to view the contents of Fedora Planet. In order to do this, it uses the project's [RSS feed](http://planet.fedoraproject.org/rss20.xml).\r\n\r\n***\r\n# The App\r\nThe application combines a beautiful UI with great functionality in order to make the perfect app. It does this all while keeping the interface simple, which allows anyone to use it. And I mean anyone. The application renders perfectly in both portrait and landscape mode to give you the opportunity to choose whichever one you like best. \r\n\r\nThe application includes a feature that makes sharing easy. What is it? A share button. This button allows you to share the article with anyone you want easily. \r\n\r\nThe application also includes a favorites section. This section allows you to view your favorite articles with the touch of a button and to easily add and remove your favorites. \r\n\r\n![landscape](https://github.com/areke/PlanetFedora/raw/master/demo/images/landscape.png)\r\n\r\nIf you would like to read more about the application, visit our [wiki page](https://github.com/areke/PlanetFedora/wiki).\r\n\r\n# Download\r\nThe app's .apk file can be downloaded right [here](https://github.com/areke/PlanetFedora/raw/master/bin/PlanetFedora.apk).\r\n\r\n***\r\n# Contribute\r\n\r\nPlease contribute if you know a way to make this better.
